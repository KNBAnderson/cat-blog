        <li>Sparkles</li>
        <li>Bubbles</li>
        <li>Sully</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="nice">Sparkles</h2>
      <p class="nice">Sparkles is definitely the laziest of them all. He sleeps all day and only gets up to eat.</p>

    <h2 class="wow">Bubbles</h2>
      <p class="wow">Bubbles is the odd one out of the bunch because he thinks that he is a dog.
        He chases the other cats around and even knows how to play fetch.</h2>

    <h2 class="cool">Sully</h2>
      <p class="cool">Sully is just your average cat. His favorite thing is catnip.<p>
